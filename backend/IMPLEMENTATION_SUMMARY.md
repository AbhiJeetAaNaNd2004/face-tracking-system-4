### API Endpoint Tests

#### 1. Master Admin Login
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/auth/login/" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "admin@company.com", "password": "]JVNtGcusH9O;@Ka"}'
```
**Result:** ✅ Successfully authenticated and received JWT token

#### 2. Master Admin Access Rights
```json
{
    "can_create_admins": true,

    "can_view_users": true,
    "can_manage_system": true,
    "designation": "admin",
    "is_master_admin": true
}
```

#### 3. Create Employee Account (Master Admin)
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/user-management/create-employee" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <master_admin_token>" \
  -d '{"email": "john.doe@company.com", "department": "Engineering", "phone_number": "+1234567890"}'
```
**Result:** ✅ Employee created with temporary password

#### 4. Create Admin Account (Master Admin)

curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/user-management/create-admin" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <master_admin_token>" \
  -d '{"email": "admin.user@company.com", "department": "IT Administration"}'
```
**Result:** ✅ Admin created with temporary password

#### 5. Regular Admin Login and Access Test
```json
{
    "can_create_admins": false,
    "can_create_employees": true,
    "can_view_users": true,
    "can_manage_system": false,
